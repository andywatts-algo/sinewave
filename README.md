* Validate same amplitude, but different frequency
* Validate different amplitude and frequency



# Sinewave
* Learnings
    * Env should be different everytime



## Test #1
* Data
    * 1000 rows
    * 100 frequency
* Environment   
    * Obs: Last 3 days price change   
    * Action: Up|Down   
    * Reward: +1 if correct; -1.5 if incorrect   
* Training
    * 978 ep_rew_mean after 1M episodes
* Testing
    * Same amplitude and frequency, but different start? WORKS
    * Different frequency? FAIL
